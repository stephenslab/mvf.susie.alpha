# mvf.susie.alpha

R package implementing the multiple and multivariate functional Sum of Single Effect methods.

## Quick Start

Install and load the package:

```R
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("william-denault/mvf.susie.alpha")
```

If this doesn't work, try to install the package instead by
downloading the git repository, and installing from the repository on
your computer (this is assuming that your R working directory is a
directory containing the git repository):

```R
remotes::install_local("mvf.susie.alpha")
```
